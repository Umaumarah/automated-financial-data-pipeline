📈 Automated Financial Data Pipeline

An end-to-end automated financial data pipeline built using Python, APIs, SQLite, and Matplotlib.
This project fetches real-time market data (stocks & crypto), cleans and transforms it, loads it into a SQLite database, and automatically generates visualizations.

This pipeline is designed to run on a single command (python run_pipeline.py), making it ideal for automation, cron jobs, and production-level workflows.
